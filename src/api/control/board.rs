//! Task board scheduler: server-owned orchestration of worker missions.
//!
//! The boss agent registers a task DAG once (via the orchestrator MCP's
//! `plan_tasks`, which lands in `MissionStore::upsert_board_tasks`). From that
//! point the control loop owns the schedule:
//!
//! - `scheduler_pass` (throttled inside the actor's 100ms tick) spawns a
//!   worker mission for every dependency-satisfied `pending` task while
//!   capacity allows, sweeps zombies (workers lost to a restart), and — this
//!   is the control-plane part — sends a generic, content-free WAKE to a boss
//!   when its board has tasks needing a decision and the boss is idle.
//! - `on_worker_settled` (called when a parallel runner parks) classifies the
//!   outcome, retries failures once, and persists the result. It does NOT push
//!   any message to the boss.
//!
//! Pull model (why): the boss reacts to its OWN board state, not to a pushed
//! per-task digest. The wake carries no task/board specifics, so even if it
//! were misdelivered, the receiving mission would just read its own (empty)
//! board and end its turn — one board's work can never leak into another
//! mission. All control-plane sends are STRICT (`UserMessage { strict: true }`):
//! delivered only to the exact target, never `/goal`-rewritten, never routed to
//! the main session. They self-send into the actor's command channel via
//! `try_send` (never awaited — the scheduler runs on the consuming task).
